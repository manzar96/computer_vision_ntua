Labs exercises in NTUA (2018) for the Computer Vision course 8th semester

In this course, we studied several concepts of <b>Computer Vision</b> such as:
* Image Geometry and Creation of Images
* 2D and 3D Image analysis with linear filters and Fourier Analysis (mostly Gabor filters and Wavelts) or non-linear methods.
* Multiscalar Image Analysis
* Edge and Feature Detection
* Shape Analysis
* Texture Analysis and Modeling
* Segmentation
* Detection of 2D Optical Flow and 3D Movement
* 3D Shape estimation
* Object and Action Detection

The course also has a lab with the following assignments, which were done using Matlab:

<b> Lab1:</b><br>
Edge detection in noisy grayscale images <b>(Part 1)</b>, interest points detection <b>(Part 2)</b> and image classification using the BOVW (bag of visual words) concept <b>(Part 3)</b>. In Part 3, the training dataset is not provided due to its large size.

<b>Lab2:</b><br> 
Tracking of human face using the skin colour. The training was
 done by a
 parameter fit to a 2D Gaussian function <b>(Part 1)</b>. In the next part, we calculated the optical flow of the face along the different frames of the video and applied the Lucas-Kanade Algorithm in order to keep track of it <b>(Part 2)</b>.
